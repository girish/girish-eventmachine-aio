<h1>Non Blocking IO</h1>
<p>An I/O operation that is only initiated if it does
not by itself cause the thread of execution
requesting the I/O to be blocked from further use
of the processor</p>
<p>
read(fd, len) / write(fd, len) returns
EWOULDBLOCK if it cannot read/write any data, other wise the
number of bytes read.
</p>
<p>An attribute of the FD (O_NONBLOCK) changes its behavior</p>
