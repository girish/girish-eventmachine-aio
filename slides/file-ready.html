<h3>When is a fd ready?</h3>
<p>As seen, IO Multiplexing depends on kernel informing about readiness to process.  </p>
<p>Readiness depends on type of file</p>
<p>sockets are ready when input/output avialable.</p>
<p>sockets are ready when an incoming connection established on listening socket 
.</p>
<p>pipe's read end is ready if atleast one byte is there to read irrespective of length requested.</p>
<p>Disk files are always marked ready. So these don't work.</p>
