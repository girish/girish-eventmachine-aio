<h3>Epoll</h3>
<ul>
<li>First a descriptor, say, epoll_fd is created for all files needed to monitor using epoll_create.</li>
<li>Then fds for monitoring are associated with this discriptor using epoll_ctl along with event on fd to monitor.
   The kernel records this fact in a list associated with the underlying
  open file description, and whenever an I/O operation that makes the file
  descriptor ready is performed kernel add it to the epoll fd.
</li>
<li>It returns only the fds that are ready for IO, so epoll is much much faster than select/poll. Scales well on large no of fds.</li>
</ul>
