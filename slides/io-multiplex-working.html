  /*readfs, writefds are fd sets passed. FD_ZERO() clears a set. FD_SET() and

<p>After select/poll call kernel loops through the fd array passed, to check the state changes and set a bit if occurred.</p>
<p>When it returns, we have to loop through all the fds and check for set using FD_ISSET </p>
<p>Inefficient for large no of fds.</p>
