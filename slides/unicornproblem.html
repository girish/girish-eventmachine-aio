<h3>But..</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unicorn is not suited for all applications. unicorn is optimized for applications that are CPU/memory/disk intensive and spend little time waiting on external resources (e.g. a database server or external API).
</li>
<li>Unicorn is highly inefficient for Comet/reverse-HTTP/push applications where the HTTP connection spends a large amount of time idle. Nevertheless, the ease of troubleshooting, debugging, and management of unicorn may still outweigh the drawbacks for these applications.
