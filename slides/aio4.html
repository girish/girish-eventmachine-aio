<h3>Asynchronous IO</h3>
<p>Until now we have been told by the kernel about the readiness of the fd. After that, we have to make a read/write call on the fd to do IO</p>
<p>IO operation is synchronous to thread of execution i.e. reading of actual data.</p>
<p>In AIO, We register a call back with kernel, and kernel will call it when data is ready in its buffers with data as a argument or a signal is sent which can be handled using custom handler.</p>
