<h3>IO Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Non Blocking IO we receive the state/event changes on fds asynchronously. But the I/O operations are handled synchronously</li>
<li>With Epoll we can monitor large no of fds(I mean sockets and other stream fds on which less activity happens) for IO and do the processing in single thread.</li>
<li>This means we can keep the connection alive(ie need not close socket fds) and keep adding as many as possible.</li>
</ul>
