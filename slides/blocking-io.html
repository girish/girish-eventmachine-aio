<h3>Blocking IO</h3>
<p>An I/O operation that may itself cause
the requesting thread of execution to be
blocked from further use of the
processor.
</p>
<p>That means, our process is put into sleep if such an operation occurs. Kernel wakes up when data is avialable.</p>
<p>Eg:socket.accept(), socket.recv(), pipe.read() until any input is avialable for reading.</p>
