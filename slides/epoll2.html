<h3>Epoll</h3>
<ul>
<li>First an alias(epoll fd) for all files needed to monitor is created using epoll_create.</li>
<li>Then fds for monitoring are associated with this alias using epoll_ctl along with event on fd to monitor.
   The kernel records this fact in a list associated with the underlying
  open file description, and whenever an I/O operation that makes the file
  descriptor ready is performed kernel add it to the epoll fd.
</li>
</ul>
